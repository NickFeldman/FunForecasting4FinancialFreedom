# FunForecasting4FinancialFortunes


Hello and thank you for checking out my time series LSTM model project.

The purpose of this project is to attempt to use an LSTM model or model(s) to
predict future currency exchange rates over various periods of time after being 
trained on historical data.

I started this project to explore time series data and neural networks and LSTMs
further.

This project used datasets that are freely available, or were at the time that 
the data was downloaded, which was all on or before 1/10/2021.

This is a list of the origins of the datasets:

The currency pair data came from Forextester.com and was publicly available
without a login required.

The US Federal Reserve interest rate data came directly from the Federal
Reserve. No login was required for any of the data that I downloaded and it is
freely available to the public

The European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate data came through Quandl, which
did require a login to retrieve it. However, it was available with only a free
account and did not require extensive personal information or any method of
payment "just in case" unlike some free accounts.
